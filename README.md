# Native entanglement misfolding contributes to age-associated structural changes across the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* proteome

This repository evaluates the association between native non-covalent lasso entanglements (NCLEs) and age-associated structural changes in the yeast proteome. It includes:

- Statistical association workflows (protein-level, residue-level, and logistic regression models linking NCLEs and age-associated structural changes to abundance increase)
- Coarse-grained (CG) folding and misfolding simulation workflows
- Figure-generation notebooks
- A reproducible software environment (`bioenv.yml`)

## Design choices

This project does not use a formal workflow manager (for example, Snakemake or Nextflow) because:

- The analysis flow is linear.
- Major analysis steps are deterministic and notebook-based.
- The dataset is fixed and relatively small.
- Transparency and interactivity are priorities.

Given this scope, notebook-based orchestration was chosen for readability and accessibility.

## Data overview

This project uses two primary input datasets for the association analyses.

### Input data (raw data)


| Data              | Original source                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LiP-MS data       | [Molecular Cell dataset](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276523006512)          |
| Entanglement data | [JMB dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022283624000251?via%3Dihub) |


### Processed data (used in notebooks)

The above inputs are integrated into two processed datasets in `statistical_association/data/`:

| File | Proteins | Used by | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SC_Ent_no_transmembrane_secretory.pkl` | 1,887 | `1_0_*`, `1_1_*` | Merged LiP-MS and entanglement data, with transmembrane and secretory proteins excluded. |
| `SC_ENT_ABD.xlsx` | 1,776 | `2_NCLE_ASC_abundance_3_models.ipynb` | Per-protein NCLE status, structural-change status, standardized length, and abundance-increase status. Subset of the 1,887 proteins above with abundance measurements. |

`SC_Ent_no_transmembrane_secretory.pkl` combines:

- **LiP-MS data**: quantified proteins from the LiP-MS experiment, including whether each protein shows age-related structural changes (`SC`) and the positions of significant proteolytic alterations (`Cutsite_residues`).
- **Entanglement data**: NCLE status per protein (`entangled`), entangled-region annotations (`entangled_residues`, `clustered_entangled_residues`), and AlphaFold protein length (`length_AF`).

`SC_ENT_ABD.xlsx` adds a binary abundance label (`Abd_up`: 1 = abundance increases with age) to the NCLE and structural-change labels.

Filtering applied to both processed datasets:

- Only proteins with average pLDDT >= 70 are included in the entanglement-based integration.
- Transmembrane and secretory proteins are excluded.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Conda or Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Optional (recommended): [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) for faster solving

All required packages are listed in `bioenv.yml`.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository and enter the project directory.
2. Choose one environment manager path below.

#### Option A (recommended): Conda + Mamba

Install `mamba` once into your Conda **base** environment:

```bash
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
```

Then create and activate the project environment:

```bash
mamba env create -f bioenv.yml
conda activate bioenv
```

Note: Installing `mamba` in `base` only adds the `mamba` command.  
Project dependencies are still installed in a separate environment (`bioenv`), not in `base`.

#### Option B: Conda only (no mamba)

Caution: Conda's dependency solver can be very slow for large environments.  
If solving takes too long, use Option A (`mamba`) for significantly faster environment creation.

```bash
conda env create -f bioenv.yml
conda activate bioenv
```

1. Verify the environment:

```bash
python --version
```

## Reproducing results

All statistical analyses and figure-generation workflows are executed primarily in **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) files.  
To reproduce results as documented, Jupyter is required.

### Jupyter quick start (for non-expert users)

After activating `bioenv`, launch Jupyter from the notebook directory (`statistical_association/notebook/`), and run notebook cells top-to-bottom (`Run All`):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Quick runtime example (typical laptop, 1 CPU core):

- `1_0_SC_Ent_Protein_level.ipynb`: usually a few seconds
- `1_1_SC_Ent_Residue_level.ipynb`: usually a few seconds
- `2_NCLE_ASC_abundance_3_models.ipynb`: usually a few seconds

| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Statistical association (Jupyter notebooks) | Minimal                     | 1 core                                      | 8 GB  | None     | Negligible (few seconds)                                                                        |
| CG simulations                              | Depends on trajectory count | 1 core (CPU-only) or 1 CPU + 1 GPU (faster) | 8 GB+ | Optional | ~~3 h for short proteins (~~100 residues, 1.5 us) to ~~1 day for long proteins (~~800 residues) |


Statistical association analyses run on modest hardware (for example, a laptop with 8 GB RAM and 1 CPU core). CG simulations can run on CPU only and benefit from optional GPU acceleration.
